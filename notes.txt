Getting the right amount of protein per day depends on three types of training. 

Plan: 
    1. Begin with the recomp phase to build muscle and lose fat at the same time.
    2. Once you have the muscle and the desired fat, change to bulking phase. 
    3. Finally, to reduce fat further change to cutting phase to get a defined physique.

    #Cutting (increase protein): fewer calories from food, so less body fat. Much more likely to break down muscle tissue as a fuel source.
        #Between 1.8 - 2.7g per kg of bodyweight
        #Between 0.8 - 1.2g per lb of bodyweight

    #Bulking (less protein): build a lot of muscle and bulk. Well fed, so your body is less likely to break down muscle tissue as a fuel source.
        #Between 1.6 - 2.2g per kg of bodyweight
